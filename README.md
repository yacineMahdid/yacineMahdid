### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Yacine!

I'm the CTO of [GRAD4](https://www.grad4.com/) a tech company which enable manufacturing companies to connect, find and collaborate with local supplier 10 times faster than their current process!

I'm also a PhD student at the Biosignal Interaction and Personhood Technology Lab ([BIAPT](http://www.moraeslab.com/biapt/)) lab at McGill university using machine learning techniques to gain insight into the brain correlate of consciousness and pain!

I love to teach machine learning and computational neuroscience, you can head over to my [youtube channels](https://www.youtube.com/c/codethiscodethat) to check out my tutorials!

The best way to reach me out for business inquiry is through [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yacine-mahdid-809425163/), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/CodeThisCodeTh1) for less pressing issues!
